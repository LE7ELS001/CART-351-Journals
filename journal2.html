                    <p>The focus of this week's course was the Python runtime environment. When running Python, you may
                        encounter issues such
                        as version updates, which can cause problems in the running environment. Therefore, environment
                        management is necessary.
                        We use Conda as the environment management tool. At the same time, we also use the command line
                        "pip install xxx" to install
                        the required libraries.

                        In addition, we went over the dict type in Python in detail. This type can nest multiple types.
                        For example, the key can
                        be a string and the value can be a list, like: shopping = {'vegetables': ['a', 'b', 'c']}. It
                        can also have a key whose value is another key-value pair, for example:
                        shopping_2 = {'vegetables': {'green': ['a', 'b', 'c'], 'orange': ['e', 'f', 'g']}}. When you
                        want to access a specific piece of data, you need to use the correct order of indexing, for
                        example: print(shopping_2['vegetables']['green'][1])
                        This week's assignment is related to accessing APIs, and it involves the requests library. The
                        API provides information
                        about local weather conditions. When you use get to retrieve data, it returns a collection of
                        data that includes lists
                        and dictionaries. You need to use indices to locate the data you need, then access the
                        corresponding keys (using
                        x.keys()), and finally iterate to get the values, for example:for value in datakey:
                        print(weather[value])
                    </p>
