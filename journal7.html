                    <h2> Connecting Flask with MongoDB Atlas </h2>
                    In today's class, I learned how to integrate a Flask web application with a MongoDB Atlas cloud
                    database. This lesson
                    helped me understand how backend web frameworks interact with cloud-hosted databases, as well as the
                    importance of
                    security and structured data design. MongoDB, being a NoSQL database, stores data in flexible
                    JSON-like documents, which
                    makes it ideal for dynamic web applications. Using MongoDB Atlas's free cloud service allows us to
                    connect from anywhere
                    without worrying about local setup or IP issues.

                    <h2 style="padding-top: 15px;">Database Setup</h2>
                    We started by creating a MongoDB Atlas account, setting up a database called CART351 with a
                    collection named plantRepo,
                    and configuring network access. Then, we connected it to Flask using the Flask-PyMongo library. To
                    protect credentials
                    like usernames and passwords, we created a .env file and loaded variables securely using the
                    python-dotenv package.

                    <h2 style="padding-top: 15px;">Database Operations</h2>
                    Once the connection worked, we tested CRUD operations. I learned how to insert documents with
                    insert_one() and
                    insert_many(), retrieve them using find() and find_one(), and update data through operators like
                    $set and $inc. We also
                    used comparison and logical operators such as $gt, $and, and $or to filter results, and added
                    sorting and limiting
                    options to control query output. Later, we converted date strings into datetime objects to perform
                    time-based queries

                    <h2 style="padding-top: 15px;">Frontend and Backend Integration</h2>
                    Finally, we linked the backend to the frontend using HTML templates, CSS styling, and JavaScript's
                    Fetch API. This
                    allowed users to submit plant information and upload images dynamically to the database. It
                    demonstrated how all parts
                    of a full-stack system connect seamlessly.
