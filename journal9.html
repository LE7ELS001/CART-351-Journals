                    <h2> EX-5 </h2>
                    This week, I and my teammate worked on integrating a MongoDB Atlas database with Flask and using the
                    stored data to generate different
                    visual patterns in the browser. The first step was setting up the database connection using
                    environment variables and replacing the URI in server.py.
                    This part helped reinforce how Flask interacts with MongoDB using flask_pymongo.
                    Next, we implemented the required MongoDB queries using operators like .find(), .sort(), and $in.
                    While writing them, I
                    became more familiar with how MongoDB handles filtering and sorting. Writing these queries helped me
                    understand how to
                    structure data retrieval more efficiently.
                    The final part was visualization. Using JavaScript, we received the JSON data through fetch() and
                    created custom display
                    functions depending on which query was selected. During this step, I learned how to work with
                    asynchronous data and how to update the DOM dynamically after the response
                    arrived. I also got more familiar with separating logic: the server only handled querying, while the
                    client handled
                    layout and rendering. Overall, this part clarified how front-end rendering can respond dynamically
                    to database results rather than fixed
                    content.
